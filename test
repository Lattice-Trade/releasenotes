Release Notes - 2025/04/23
New Features
Collateral Arrangement/Lending
Redirect user to base URL
If a user tries to view a Loan or Collateral Arrangement they don't have access to, they'll be redirected to the main loans page (e.g., app.membranelabs.com/loans). This helps keep things running smoothly and ensures a better experience for everyone.

This situation might occur when a user has a loan with one institution and then switches to another that does not hold the current loan.

Collateral Arrangement Table Refactor
The team has implemented a complete refactor of the Collateral Arrangement Table, including:

Displaying all relevant data for each CA

A Secondary Table that expands the primary table, providing a summary of the linked positions for the selected CA

Filters apply only to the primary table.
